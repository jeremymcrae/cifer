Title: CNV Inheritance from Exome Read-Depths

Description: Classifies the inheritance of CNV calls using exome read-depth
    data. This classifies each CNV as maternally, paternally, biparentally
    inherited, or not inherited. Attempts to separate not inherited CNVs into
    false positive CNV calls and true de novos. Allows for uncertain
    classifications, and also includes some error states.
